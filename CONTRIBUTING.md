Contributions are more than welcome:

- If you think you found a bug, create an issue and supply the minimum amount
of code triggering the bug so it can be reproduced.
- If you want to fix a bug, you can send a pull request. It should contains a
new test or update an existing one to cover that bug.
- If you think Gomail lacks a feature, you can open an issue or send a pull
request. I want to keep Gomail code and API as simple as possible so please
describe your needs so we can discuss whether this feature should be added to
Gomail or not.
